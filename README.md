# SearchGif

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0-rc.2.

please install the dependencies by running `npm install`

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `npm run prod` for a production build.

If you want to serve the prod build you can run `npm run start-prod` and after is finished navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`.

## What is next

Next steps (since the time cap was around 2h) would be writing cypess and unit test in order to make everything prod ready.

## Using the app

The app is fairly simple. I didnt want to add any button for search since its straight forward the search bar with a small debounce on it and it will display the list of gifs you searched.

Some funcionality is hardcoded since its a demo app, but the baseline to expand from it is "drawn" in this app.
